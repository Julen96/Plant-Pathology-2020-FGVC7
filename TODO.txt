TODOS:


----------------- Batch Confusion Norm -----------------

- Check if the dilation rate is well specified, with what it tells in the Paper
- Check if there is the code online!
- Check if ASSP can be done as in the Paper, same structure
- Do function to pass always different images in the batch to train the model
- Test model in XSEDE -> Doesn't run on GPU!




----------------- Localization, Pooling and Embedding -----------------

- Global K-Max Pooling -> DONE
- Embedding Layer, loss -> DONE

-------------------- TODOS -----------------------
- The difference between the losses is too high. -> Pre-process the images to normalize them -> Divide them in folders to use method learnt in class
- Use another Backbone -> EfficientNetB7
- Try using only Backbone without additional Losses
- Try Using Backbone without GlobalKMaxPooling

TODOS:


----------------- Batch Confusion Norm -----------------

- Check if the dilation rate is well specified, with what it tells in the Paper
- Check if there is the code online!
- Check if ASSP can be done as in the Paper, same structure
- Do function to pass always different images in the batch to train the model
- Test model in XSEDE




----------------- Localization, Pooling and Embedding -----------------

- Global K-Max Pooling
	- Problems reshaping, two possible solutions
		- Reshape before the K-Max layer (Problems at lower level where I cannot reach)
		- Reshape in the model -> Problems with "None" for batch. CHOOSE THIS!
- 



-------------------- GLOBAL PROBLEMS -----------------------

- The accuracy seems to get stucked at around 0.32, check if the loss is correct

TODOS:


----------------- Batch Confusion Norm -----------------

- Check if the dilation rate is well specified, with what it tells in the Paper
- Check if there is the code online!
- Check if ASSP can be done as in the Paper, same structure
- Do function to pass always different images in the batch to train the model
- Test model in XSEDE -> Doesn't run on GPU!




----------------- Localization, Pooling and Embedding -----------------

- Global K-Max Pooling -> DONE
- Embedding Layer, loss -> - Within-class loss: The tensors are immutable! They run in the GPU, numpy only in CPU
- More complex algorithm to do within-class loss, without any for loop or if


-------------------- GLOBAL PROBLEMS -----------------------
